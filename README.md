# React Coursework

This repository contains code and exercises from a React course I'm currently taking on Udemy. The primary goal of this course is to **refresh and strengthen my React skills** in preparation for building a more advanced, personal **portfolio website project**.

## 🚀 Why This Course?

After working with React in the past, I wanted a structured refresher to:
- Revisit core React concepts like components, props, state, and hooks
- Practice modern React patterns and best practices
- Gain confidence before starting a larger, real-world project

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Functional components and JSX
- State management with `useState` and `useEffect`
- Props and component reusability
- Conditional rendering and lists
- Event handling
- React Router
- Basic project structure and component organization

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each section or milestone of the course will have its own folder or commit history entry to make it easy to follow along with my progress.

## 🧩 Final Goal

This course serves as a stepping stone toward creating a **fully custom React-based portfolio site**, where I can showcase:
- My skills and projects
- Interactive UI elements
- Responsive and modern design
